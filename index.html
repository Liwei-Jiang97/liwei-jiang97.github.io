      Starting from August 2025, I will join the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University as an assistant professor. I am looking for PhD students to join my group in Fall 2025. Please contact me if you have a background in Math, Stats, OR, or CS and are interested in my research!

        I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I work with 
        Professor  <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/" class="purple"> Ashwin Pananjady </a> and 
        Professor <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/katya-scheinberg/" class="purple"> Katya Scheinberg </a>. I am interested in problems that lie at the intersection of optimization, geometry, statistics, and data science.

        In 2024, I received my Ph.D. from the School of Operations Research 
        and Information Engineering at Cornell University, where I was very 
        fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://damek.github.io/" class="purple">
        Damek Davis</a>. Prior to graduate school, I obtained my B.S. from 
        the Department of Mathematics at Nanjing University in 2019. In 2018, 
        I spent one year as a visiting student in the Department 
        of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

      Outside of research, I am an avid climber. I have just sent Dragon Turns (V9) at Gunks!
