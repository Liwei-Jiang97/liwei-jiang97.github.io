        I am an assistant in Edwardson School of Industrial Engineering </a> at Purdue University, where I was appointed as a Solberg Academic Excellence Scholar. I am interested in problems that lie at the intersection of optimization, geometry, statistics, and data science.

        Prior to the position at Purdue, I spent one year as a postdoc in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I worked with 
        Professor  <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/" class="purple"> Ashwin Pananjady </a> and 
        Professor <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/katya-scheinberg/" class="purple"> Katya Scheinberg </a>. In 2024, I received my Ph.D. from the School of Operations Research 
        and Information Engineering at Cornell University, where I was advised by Professor <a href="https://damek.github.io/" class="purple">
        Damek Davis</a>. Prior to graduate school, I obtained my B.S. from 
        the Department of Mathematics at Nanjing University in 2019. In 2018, 
        I spent one year as a visiting student in the Department 
        of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
